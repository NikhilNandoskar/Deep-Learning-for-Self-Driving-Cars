# Deep-Learning-for-Self-Driving-Cars

**Problem Statement**

Building a prototype of a 1/10th autonomous car using state of the art Deep Learning techniques and Computer Vision. Deploying the trained model on Nvidia Jetson TX2 for real-time object detection.

**Hardware used**

NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Arduino, LIDAR sensors, IMU Sensor
Tools, Languages and Libraries used: Gym gazebo, Robotic Operating System, Python, C++, TensorFlow, OpenCV

This research is done for the Networked Robotic Systems Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University and is scheduled in the following parts:

1) A thorough Literature Review of conventional and state of art techniques used in Autonomous Vehicles.
2) Successfully implemented real-time Yolo v2 model for object detection, but the model is heavy to be deployed on Nvidia Jetson TX2 as it    uses VGG-16 as its base model.
3) Finally, implemented Mobilenet Single Shot Multibox Detector and deployed on Nvidia Jetson TX2.
4) Also, applied transfer learning on the Mobilenet Single Shot Multibox Detector model for detecting road symbols.

Worked with the Advanced Vehicle Team (AVT) at Pennsylvania State University as a Deep Learning Engineer.

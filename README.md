# Deep-Learning-for-Self-Driving-Cars
I'm working on building a 1/10th Autonomous car. I have successfully built an Object Detection model for the car, I'm currently working on the motion planning part of it. I have the two Lidars, IMU sensors working and will train my car for Lidar data. The final step is to apply sensor fusion and drive the car autonomously in a laboratory dynamic environment.
